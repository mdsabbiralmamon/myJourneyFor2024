## 33-1 How Does Internet Work, HTTP Vs HTTPs And What Is An API

Sure, let's break down each of these topics:

### How Does the Internet Work?
The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using a common set of protocols. At its core, the internet relies on a system called the Internet Protocol Suite (commonly known as TCP/IP), which enables data packets to be transmitted across networks. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:

1. **Devices**: Devices such as computers, smartphones, servers, etc., connect to the internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or other means like Wi-Fi or cellular networks.

2. **Data Transmission**: When you request to access a website or any online resource, your device sends a request to the server hosting that resource.

3. **Routing**: The request travels through various networks and routers, following a path determined by the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the destination server.

4. **Server Response**: The server processes the request and sends back the requested data (web page, file, etc.) to your device.

5. **Data Display**: Your device receives the data and renders it in a format that you can understand and interact with (e.g., displaying a web page in a browser).

### HTTP vs HTTPS:
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: HTTP is the protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, as well as how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. However, HTTP data is transmitted in plain text, making it susceptible to interception and manipulation by attackers.

- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: HTTPS is an extension of HTTP with added security features. It uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to encrypt data transmitted between the client (e.g., your browser) and the server. This encryption ensures that even if intercepted, the data remains secure and private. Websites using HTTPS are identified by the padlock icon in the browser's address bar.

### What Is an API?
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that developers can use to request and exchange information between different software components or systems. APIs enable developers to access the functionality of other applications or services without needing to understand their internal workings.

   APIs can be used for various purposes, including:
   - Accessing web services (e.g., social media APIs for fetching user data)
   - Integrating third-party functionalities into applications
   - Enabling communication between different software components
   - Facilitating automation and streamlining workflows
   
   For example, social media platforms provide APIs that allow developers to integrate features like login with Facebook, share buttons, or fetching user data into their own applications. Similarly, payment gateways offer APIs for processing transactions securely within third-party applications.

## 33-2 Intro To JSON, JSON Structure, Parse, Stringify

Certainly! Let's cover the basics of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
- **JSON** stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- JSON is language-independent, meaning it can be used with any programming language.
- It's commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing configuration settings and exchanging data between different systems.

### JSON Structure:
- **Data Types**: JSON supports the following data types:
  - Strings: A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
  - Numbers: Integers or floating-point numbers.
  - Booleans: `true` or `false`.
  - Arrays: Ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
  - Objects: Collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
  - Null: Represents an empty value.
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "skills": ["JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS"],
    "address": {
      "city": "New York",
      "country": "USA"
    },
    "isEmployed": null
  }
  ```

### Parse:
- **Parsing JSON**: In programming, parsing JSON means converting a JSON string into a data structure that can be manipulated programmatically (like an object in JavaScript or a dictionary in Python).
- Most modern programming languages provide built-in functions or libraries to parse JSON strings into their respective data structures.
- For example, in JavaScript:
  ```javascript
  const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
  const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
  console.log(jsonObject.name); // Outputs: John
  console.log(jsonObject.age); // Outputs: 30
  ```

### Stringify:
- **Stringifying JSON**: Stringifying JSON means converting a data structure (such as an object or array) into a JSON-formatted string.
- This is useful when you need to send JSON data over a network or store it in a file.
- In JavaScript, you can use the `JSON.stringify()` method:
  ```javascript
  const obj = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false
  };
  const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
  console.log(jsonString); // Outputs: {"name":"John","age":30,"isStudent":false}
  ```

### Conclusion:
JSON is a simple, text-based data format that is widely used for transmitting and storing structured data. It's easy to read and write for both humans and machines, making it a popular choice for data exchange in web development, APIs, and many other applications.

Certainly! Let's go through the process of fetching data from JSONPlaceholder, a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping, and displaying that data on a user interface (UI). 

### Step 1: Fetch Data from JSONPlaceholder:
We'll use JavaScript to make a GET request to JSONPlaceholder to fetch some sample data. For example, let's fetch posts data:

```javascript
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Once data is fetched successfully, call a function to display it on UI
    displayDataOnUI(data);
  })
  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```

### Step 2: Display Data on UI:
After fetching the data, we need to display it on the user interface. For simplicity, let's assume we have an empty `<ul>` element with the id `postList` where we want to display the posts.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>JSONPlaceholder Posts</title>
</head>
<body>
  <ul id="postList"></ul>

  <script>
    function displayDataOnUI(data) {
      const postList = document.getElementById('postList');

      // Clear existing list items
      postList.innerHTML = '';

      // Loop through each post and create list item to display
      data.forEach(post => {
        const listItem = document.createElement('li');
        listItem.textContent = post.title;
        postList.appendChild(listItem);
      });
    }

    // Fetch data when the page loads
    window.onload = () => {
      fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
          displayDataOnUI(data);
        })
        .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
    };
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML document fetches posts data from JSONPlaceholder API and displays the titles of those posts in an unordered list (`<ul>`). The `displayDataOnUI` function is responsible for creating list items (`<li>`) for each post title and appending them to the list. The data fetched from the API is passed to this function for display.
