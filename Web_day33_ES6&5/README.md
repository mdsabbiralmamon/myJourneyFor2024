## Module 30-1 ES6 Intro Difference Between Var, Let And Const

In ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), var, let, and const are all used for variable declaration, but they have some key differences in terms of scope, hoisting, and mutability.

-   Use var for variables that need function or global scope (though its use is less common in modern JavaScript).
-   Use let for variables that need block scope and might be reassigned.
-   Use const for variables that should remain constant and whose value shouldn't change.
