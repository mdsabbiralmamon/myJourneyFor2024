## 35-1 What Really Is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language primarily used for building interactive and dynamic web pages. Originally created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation, JavaScript has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is widely used both on the client-side (in web browsers) and server-side (with platforms like Node.js).

Key features of JavaScript include:

1. **Client-Side Scripting:** JavaScript is primarily known for its use in web browsers to make web pages interactive. It can manipulate HTML and CSS to dynamically update the content and appearance of web pages without requiring a full page reload.

2. **Cross-Platform:** JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge, making it a cross-platform language for web development.

3. **Event-Driven:** JavaScript allows developers to create event-driven interactions, meaning actions are triggered by user interactions like clicks, scrolls, and keyboard input.

4. **Asynchronous Programming:** JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await, allowing developers to write non-blocking code that can handle multiple operations concurrently.

5. **Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables can hold values of any type without explicit type declarations. This flexibility can make coding faster but requires careful attention to avoid unexpected behavior.

6. **Prototypal Inheritance:** JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance to facilitate object-oriented programming. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, providing a flexible and powerful way to structure code.

7. **Extensive Ecosystem:** JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, that streamline web development by providing pre-built components and tools for building complex web applications.

Overall, JavaScript's versatility and ubiquity have made it a cornerstone of web development, enabling developers to create rich, interactive web experiences across various platforms and devices.
