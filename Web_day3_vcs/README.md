## ✨ Module 3-1 What Is Version Control System, Git Vs GitHub

### What is version control system?
<p>A version control system (VCS) is a software tool that helps manage changes to source code or any set of files. It allows multiple developers to work collaboratively on a project, keeping track of changes, and coordinating updates. The primary goals of version control are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Track Changes: A VCS keeps a record of every change made to the code or files over time. This includes who made the change, when it was made, and what specific changes were implemented.</li>

<li>Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. The VCS enables developers to merge their changes and resolve conflicts.</li>

<li>Backup and Recovery: VCS acts as a backup system, providing a history of changes. If something goes wrong or a mistake is made, it's possible to roll back to a previous state.</li>

<li>Branching and Merging: Developers can create branches to work on features or bug fixes independently. These branches can later be merged back into the main codebase. This allows for parallel development and experimentation.</li>

<li>Traceability: VCS provides a detailed history of changes, making it easier to understand how a project has evolved. This is useful for debugging, auditing, and tracking down issues.</li>
</ol>

### There are two main types of version control systems:

<ol>
<li>Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): In a CVCS, there is a central server that stores the repository, and developers check out files from this central repository. Examples include CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and SVN (Apache Subversion).</li>

<li>Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): In a DVCS, each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history. Examples include Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar.<li>

<p>Git is one of the most widely used version control systems. It's a distributed system known for its speed, flexibility, and popularity in open-source projects.</p>

### Why version control system is needed?

<p>collaboration, storing versions, re storing previous versions, backup, </p>

### What is GIT?
<p>Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become the standard for version control in many development projects. Git is known for its speed, flexibility, and efficiency, making it a popular choice for both small and large-scale software projects.</p>

<p>Key features and concepts of Git include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Distributed Version Control: Every user working on a Git project has a local copy of the entire repository, including its history. This allows users to work offline and independently.</li>

<li>Branching and Merging: Git makes branching and merging simple and efficient. Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Changes made in different branches can be easily merged back together.</li>

<li>Committing: Developers use commits to save changes to the local repository. Each commit has a unique identifier and includes information about the changes made, such as the author, timestamp, and a commit message.</li>

<li>Remote Repositories: Git supports remote repositories, enabling collaboration among multiple developers. Changes made by one developer can be pushed to a shared remote repository, and others can pull those changes to stay up-to-date.</li>

<li>GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket: These are web-based platforms that host Git repositories and provide additional collaboration features. Developers often use these platforms to share code, collaborate, and manage issues and projects.</li>
</ol>
### Git Commands: 

- git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
- git clone: Creates a copy of a remote repository on the local machine.
- git add: Adds changes to the staging area.
- git commit: Saves changes to the local repository.
- git push: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.
- git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the local branch.
- git merge: Combines changes from different branches.
- git branch: Lists, creates, or deletes branches.

<p>Git has become a fundamental tool in modern software development due to its efficiency, flexibility, and the collaborative workflows it supports. It is widely used in open-source projects and by development teams in various industries. </p>
