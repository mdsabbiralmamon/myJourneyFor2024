Module Introduction: Authentication vs Authorization

In the realm of computer security and access control, two fundamental concepts play pivotal roles: authentication and authorization. Both are crucial components of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of resources within a system. Although they are often used together and are closely related, they serve distinct purposes in the realm of information security.

1. Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity attempting to access a system or resource. It ensures that the entity claiming to be a particular user is indeed that user. Authentication mechanisms typically involve the presentation of credentials, such as passwords, biometric data, security tokens, or digital certificates. The goal of authentication is to establish trust in the identity of the user or entity, thereby allowing access to authorized resources.

Key aspects of authentication include:
- Identification: Users provide a unique identifier, such as a username or email address, to the system.
- Verification: The system validates the provided identifier against stored credentials, such as passwords or cryptographic keys.
- Authentication Factors: These are the various pieces of information used to verify identity, such as something the user knows (e.g., a password), something the user possesses (e.g., a security token), or something inherent to the user (e.g., biometric data).

2. Authorization:
Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining what actions or operations a user or entity is permitted to perform within a system or on a particular resource. It follows successful authentication and defines the permissions and privileges associated with the authenticated identity. Authorization mechanisms enforce access control policies that dictate who can access what resources and under what conditions.

Key aspects of authorization include:
- Access Control Policies: These policies define the rules and criteria for granting or denying access to resources based on the authenticated identity and other contextual factors.
- Permission Management: Permissions specify the actions or operations that users are allowed or prohibited from performing on specific resources. These can include read, write, execute, delete, or more fine-grained operations.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC is a common authorization model where permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to one or more roles based on their job function or responsibilities.

In summary, while authentication focuses on verifying the identity of users or entities, authorization determines what actions those authenticated entities are allowed to perform within a system. Together, they form the foundation of access control and security mechanisms in modern computing environments, ensuring that only authorized users can access resources and that their actions are restricted according to defined policies.
