Sure! Running your first Node.js server with Express is straightforward. Below are the steps to install Node.js and Express and create a simple server.

### Step 1: Install Node.js
If you haven't installed Node.js yet, you can download and install it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version, as it's more stable.

After installing Node.js, you can check if it's properly installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:

```bash
node -v
```

This command will display the installed Node.js version.

### Step 2: Create a New Project Directory
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-node-server
cd my-node-server
```

### Step 3: Initialize a New Node.js Project
Initialize a new Node.js project by running:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command will create a `package.json` file with default values.

### Step 4: Install Express
Now, let's install Express in your project directory:

```bash
npm install express
```

### Step 5: Create Your First Server File
Create a new file named `index.js` in your project directory and add the following code to create a simple Express server:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
```

### Step 6: Run Your Server
To run your server, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the following output:

```
Server running at http://localhost:3000/
```

Now, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Node.js, set up an Express server, and run your first Node.js server. You can now start building more complex applications using Node.js and Express!
